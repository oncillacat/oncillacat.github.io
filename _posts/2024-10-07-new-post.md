## Quick note: how to create a NA data frame with desired rows and column
how to create an empty data frame so you can fill your desired data in later? 

Well the answer is! create an empty matrix frist. So here is an example of creating an empty data frame by creating the an empty 2 by 12 matrix
```r
#creating matrix with NAs, just leave where you used to fill data blank
#here is a way to create such matrixs
NA.matrix <-matrix(,nrow=12,ncol=2)
#then we redegine the matrix as a data frame
data.frame(NA.matrix)

#OR you can combine those 2 commands and make it oneline 
data.frame(matrix(,nrow=12,ncol=2))
```
