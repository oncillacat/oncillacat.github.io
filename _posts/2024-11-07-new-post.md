Didn't really make the next post before this thrusday. so… here is the answer for pervious post

```
data_df_caffeine_Step1 <- data_df %>%
mutate(Coffee_cf = ifelse(grepl("Coffee", Drink), 95, 0)
```

So ... how to source... 2 key points
1. make sure all your relevent files are in the same folder

How to determine if a file is relevent...

one trick for this class 

Does the file name ever appear in any homework pdf **ever** once? 

if it did appeared, it's relevent. Put it in the folder!

And yes, you do need "Homework3_raw_data.csv" to successfully source for your homework 6

2. Don't do anything else other than source

Here is how I source in my homework

DON'T add ANY thing after source. You should be ok.
