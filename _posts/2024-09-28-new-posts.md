If we are translating **if loop** to written language. It should be like *when we found [condition X] then do [statement Y].* 

Note statement here is the code we wrote in the loop. 

An example if loop looks like this: 
```r
x <-5
if(x >0){print("Positive number")}
```
Please note the location of **()** and **{}*** matter!!!
Make sure **[condition X]** is in the **()** and **[statement Y]** is in the **{}**.
AKA
```r
if([condition X]){
[statement Y]
}
```
In pervious example:

[condition X] = x >0

[statement Y] = print("Positive number")

Let us use scratch block to repeat this If loop again

PS: if we put while loop in written language, it would be like *Repeat [statement Y] [X] times*
