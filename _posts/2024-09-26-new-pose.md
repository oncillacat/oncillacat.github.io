## Loop structure : for loop 

Hoory this blog got advocated in the class. Again this blog collect question I got from class (and some of class notes), 
I tried to put them in text but text can be confusing. So feel free to ask me questions in the class(they might be included in the blog though).

Now loop structure: In this blog, I will forcus on how to correctly make a loop. I will use if and for loop as examples for loop structure in the
code writing

## for loop

this photo in class shows how for loop works

An example,in R for loop looks like this
```r
for (index in 1:5){
print("I love Montreal" ))
print(paste(index*100))
print(“times!”)
}
```
Please note the location of **()** and **{}** matter!!!

And I found this code block visualization in the "scratch" help my understanding. So I rewite the code above in "scratch" block like this. 
On the **right** side is code replicated use scratch using **loop**, and on the **left** side is code replicated using scratch **not using loop**.

So the logic of the for loop is just repeat some action for certain time.

Here an example of how does it looks like when the loop run. 

***translate those scratch block back to R***

note!!! the place of **{}** , **()** matter !!!

```r
#this
{for (index in 1:5)
print("I love Montreal" ))
print(paste(index*100))
print(“times!”)
}

#or this 
for index in 1:5{
print("I love Montreal" ))
print(paste(index*100))
print(“times!”)
}
#gave your an error
