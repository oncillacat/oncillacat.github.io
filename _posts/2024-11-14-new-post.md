## chisq and fisher exact test in R (3min brief guide)
New week new post! Final season not much time. so ... quick guide on hisq and fisher exact
### step 1: make a matrix 
Make sure it looks excatly like your given on paper 

If one data frame looks like this

expected matrix in R should looks like this 
```
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]   14   16   14    7    6
[2,]   87   33   66   34   11
```
Here is the code to achieve this 
```
x <- matrix (c(14,87,16,33,14,66,7,34,6,11),ncol=5)
```
Now remember this matrix is named ***x***

### Step2 : chisq test
```
>chisq.test(x)

#below is result 

	Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  x
X-squared = 10.373, df = 4, p-value = 0.0346
```
### Step3 : fisher exact test
```
> fisher.test(x)

	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data

data:  x
p-value = 0.03794
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
```

All done!

Ps:fisher exact test is automatically two.sided but you can choose greater or less manually
