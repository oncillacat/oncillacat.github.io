## d,p,q,r tasks. What are they? 
I am sure most of you guys are confused as I am about what is p,q,r task in the r(especially for HW3,task2,3,4,5)
so I am going to go through them in this post.

## where do p,q,r task apply to ?
There ara 2 familiy of code we met that have p,q,r -tasks. `binom()`and `norm()` Here they are 
```r
#THE binom family
dbinom(x, size, prob, log = FALSE)
pbinom(q, size, prob, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qbinom(p, size, prob, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
rbinom(n, size, prob)

#THE norm family
dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)
pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)

#ps and they are actually same is statistical way 
```
some defination forom their infor page
**THE binom family** 
>This is conventionally interpreted as the number of ‘successes’ in size trials.
AKA coin toss

**THe norm family** 
Basically calculate anything under a normal distrbution curve.

## d-tasks
In function:

![binomial_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54263095-e33e-4695-992c-51dc6333bb53)

use, *n, k, p* to get *f()*
I will use dice roll and binom family as example because they are easy to explain.
```r
dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)
dbinom(x, size, prob, log = FALSE)
```

Suppose you roll a dice, and you want to know, if you roll 10 times,how likely would you get a SIX 2 times:

In this example, 

n = 10 (10 trails)

k = 2 (2 SIX need to be got) 

p = 1/6 (probaility that you get a SIX 1/6) 

so this can be calculated by:
```r
dbinom(2,10,0.1667)
```

## p-tasks
In function:

![binomial_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54263095-e33e-4695-992c-51dc6333bb53)

use, *n, k, p* to get *f()*, **in this case, k is not a single numer**

```r
pbinom(q, size, prob, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
```
Suppose you roll a dice, and you want to know, if you roll 10 times,how likely would you get a SIX **more than** 2 times:

In this example, 

n = 10 (10 rolls)

k = 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (**more than** 2 SIX need to be got) 

p = 1/6 (probaility that you get a SIX 1/6) 

so this can be calculated by:
```r
dbinom(3,10,0.1667) + dbinom(4,10,0.1667) + dbinom(5,10,0.1667) ... + dbinom(10,10,0.1667)
#OR
pbinom(2,10,0.1667,lower.tail = F)
```
Suppose you roll a dice, and you want to know, if you roll 10 times,how likely would you get a SIX **less than or equal to**  2 times:

In this example, 

n = 10 (10 rolls)

k = 1,2 (**less than or equal to** 2 SIX need to be got) 

p = 1/6 (probaility that you get a SIX 1/6) 

so this can be calculated by:
```r
dbinom(1,10,0.1667) + dbinom(2,10,0.1667) 
#OR
pbinom(2,10,0.1667)
```
## q-task
In function:

![binomial_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54263095-e33e-4695-992c-51dc6333bb53)

use, *n, f(), p* to get *k* , **in this case, k is not a single numer**

```r
qbinom(p, size, prob, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
```
Suppose you roll a dice, and you know, if you roll 10 times,there are 22.5% chance would you get a SIX **more than** k times. 
You want to know what is **k**: 

In this example, 

n = 10 (10 rolls)

k = unknown

p = 1/6 (probaility that you get a SIX 1/6)

f() = 0.225 (22.5% chance to get a SIX **more than** k times) 

so this can be calculated by:
```r
qbinom(0.225,10,0.1667,lower.tail = F)
```
## r-tasks
r is different from all d,p,q task, it is a function like sampling with conditions.As you may notice, r states for random.
```r
rbinom(n, size, prob)
rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```
Suppose you roll a dice, and you want to know, if you roll 10 times, what could number of SIX you got from the trial? Plus, you are so interested 
in this topic, so you do this trail 5 times

In this example, 

n(size in the code) = 10 (10 rolls)

k = no need

p = 1/6 (probaility that you get a SIX 1/6)

N(the n is the code) = 5 (repeat trail 5 time)

This simulation can be done by 
```r
rbinom(5,10,0.1667)
#res:2 0 1 1 3
```

Finally, only one blog this week, bc it is loooooooog
