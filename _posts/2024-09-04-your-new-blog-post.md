##Hey, this is a class note for EPIB613

Hello, following classmates. These are my notes for fall 2024 EPIB 613: Introduction to Statistical Software. So something about me before the whole blog starts: You can call me Jen, a first-year Master majoring in public health. I dealt with R for 2 years as a Data Analyst in the lab.

I learned this coding language in a rather not pleasurable way, so I hope my notes will help those who never code before. Also, although I am not the most proficient coder in this class, I am sure the most annoying one.

This blog will update with the class process:

# Introduction:

To put it simply, R is a free coding language that is widely used in labs and academics.

R studio is a UI system for R. If you play a video game, basically, the UI system makes things easier for players. It listed out 4 major part:

- your code (script)
- your operation panel (console)
- what is in your hand (environment)
- And what the hack did you do (results in viewer)

**R studio can not run without R**

That all. Feel free to ask me questions if you see me in the class. For those who bribe me with coffee, their request will be prioritized.
