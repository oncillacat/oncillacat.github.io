## Quick Note on vector power on data frame
try to find difference from this 2 results 
```
#load
COVID <-read.csv("https://raw.github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/archived_data/archived_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed_archived_0325.csv")

##Option 1
COVID_pro<-COVID %>%select(c(Province.State, Country.Region, Lat, Long))

##Option 2
COVID_pro<-COVID %>%select(c(Country.Region,Province.State, Lat, Long))
```
Yes, as you find out, the column order for ##Option 1 is 

`##     Province.State  Country.Region   Lat      Long`

And the column order for ##Option2 is 

`##     Country.Region  Province.State     Lat    Long`

Does this remind you some thing? Like something called indexing

So... bonus! Indexing with data frame above

```
Index <- c(Country.Region,Province.State, Lat, Long)
COVID_pro<-COVID %>%select(Index)
```
