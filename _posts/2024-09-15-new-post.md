## Working directory
you can check the working directory of r by looking at R studio's window on the red box.

So the meaning of the this string("~/Desktop/fall 2024/EPIB613") in the red box just mean that R is currently at 
Folder EPIB613 located in fall 2024 which is in the Desktop. 

It is kind of important to know this because if your want to read a .csv file in to your R. For example,df.csv is in the folder of 
EPIB 613 so I read it in r using command line `read.csv("df.csv")`

If df.csv is out side of EPIB613, like this. And R is still operating inside EPIB613(which with its location in the red box in perviouse picture still 
being ("~/Desktop/fall 2024/EPIB613"). `read.csv("df.csv")` will give us an error called: 'No such file or directory'
in dame red.
