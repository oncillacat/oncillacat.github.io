## 3min quick guide on one/two proptional test on R 
Proptional test! Because the class is taught during mid-term session, no one listened. Here is 3min brief guide on R.

### one sample -prop test
Let's use math homework as an example. (note: you will need process to show your work so does not copy paste this blog as your answer key) 
>Question 1. In a study to assess the effect of acupuncture on back pain, 1162 patients were randomized to one of three groups (A) acupuncture, (B) “sham” acupuncture, or (C) conventional therapy [see Sept. 24, 2007 issue of Archives of Internal Medicine].

>a)	(1 mark) Fill in the table of results:
```
                   Real acupuncture	Sham acupuncture	Conventional therapy
    N	                   387	              387	                 388
% Response	            47.6	            44.2	               27.4
Number who responded	  184.21	          171.05	            106.312
```

> b)Assume that one-third of all back pain subsides within a few weeks without medical intervention. Separately for each of the three treatment groups, test the null hypothesis that the response rate is equal to 33%.

**one sample -prop test for Real acupuncture**
```r
n <- 387
x <- 184.21
p <- 1/3

prop.test(x,n,p)

###results
#1-sample proportions test with continuity correction

#data:  x out of n, null probability p
#X-squared = 34.804, df = 1, p-value = 3.645e-09
#alternative hypothesis: true p is not equal to 0.3333333
#95 percent confidence interval:
# 0.4254445 0.5270293
#sample estimates:
#        p 
#0.4759948
```
### two sample-prop test
>	c)(3 marks) Perform a significance test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between conventional therapy and any acupuncture (i.e., combine the real and “sham” acupuncture groups into one), at the significance level of α=0.05

```r
n_acupuncture <- 387+387
x_conventional<-106.312
x_acupuncture<-184.21+171.05

prop.test(c(x_conventional,x_acupuncture),c(n_conventional,n_acupuncture))

###results
#2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

#data:  c(x_conventional, x_acupuncture) out of c(n_conventional, n_acupuncture)
#X-squared = 36.17, df = 1, p-value = 1.808e-09
#alternative hypothesis: two.sided
#95 percent confidence interval:
# -0.2435124 -0.1264721
#sample estimates:
#   prop 1    prop 2 
#0.2740000 0.4589922 
```
