## Vector 
My friend asked me what is vector in the class. So...explain what is vector is difficult.But how to make a ***Vector*** in r is just one line of code. 
```r
# this give you a vector 
vector <- c("a","b","c")
# this give your an Error
non_vector <- ("a","b","c")
```
By creating a vector, you grand this thing in the world of R **direction** and **magnitude**. (Ps: the magnitude of an vector can be 1) And I found this physics meme about vector helpful.

Now magnitude of vector can be define as No. of objects in the Vector. How about dicection? 

Well now we can check the elements in the vector by `[]`

For example, use the vector I just created. 
```r
vector[1] == "a"
vector[2] == "b"
vector[3] == "c"
```
That is all my update energe today... I will see if I have energe to do something else tomorrow.

Oh, one last things, vector can be numeric,factor,or logic, not limited to character.
```r
num_vec <- c(1,4,3,2)
logic - vec <- c(T,F,T,T)
#well...we will talk factor later bc it is confusing
```
