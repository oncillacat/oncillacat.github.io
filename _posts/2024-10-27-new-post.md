## mid term special seire: EPIB 
Happy fall break everyone. I hope you all have a nice fall break. I am sure you sre equally excited about up coming exams! That is why this mid-term special seriers coming up. This will list several study point I went over. Hopefully that will be helpful for your too. I know it is kind of messy… by all means it s made by an electronic raccoon.

# Key word for practium 1

*A Measles Outbreak in an Underimmunized Amish Community in Ohio, by Gastañaduy et al.*

***obervational study***

The **risk (or incidence proportion)** is defined as the number of persons who contracted measles during this time period divided by the number of persons at risk.

*Should persons aged 55 and older have been included in the denominator of your risk estimate?*
Depend on if people at aged 55 are at risk(can catch the disease) 

*two tests were conducted simultaneously and that all 69 persons truly had measles*
```
side note for multiple testing 
-> assume how test for positive
Simultaneouse:increase Sensitivity [Reduce False Negative]
Sequential: increase Specificity [Reduce False Positive]

For simultaneous Net sensitivity Calulation:
Net sensitivity = [(# true positives on test1) + (# true positives on test2) – (# test positive on both)] / # cases

Net sensitivity: Sensitivity test1* #cases + False Postive test1* sensitivity test2

For Sequential Net Sensitivity:
Net sensitivity = Sensitivity test1*sensitivity test2

```
Positive predictive value (PPV)  and Negative predictive value(NPV) changes along with the prevelence of the disease.

**Leas time bias**
A typical example of lead time bias is presented here using *Kaplan-Meier curves*

Median survival time corresponds to the point in follow-up when 50% of
the study population is still surviving. Using the figure to visually
approximate, the median survival time appears to be around 3 years after
diagnosis among the usual care group and 4.5 years after diagnosis for
the intervention group. If we used this statistic alone and began follow
up time from date of diagnosis (rather than date of randomization), we
might conclude that treatment **seems beneficial**.

However, a closer look at the figure shows that this seeming advantage
was **short lived**. In later years of follow up (i.e., after year 9) the proportion surviving is roughly equivalent and then falls more quickly
among those in the treated group.

example shown in this:

*How to elimate lead time bias?*

The start of follow-up differs between these two figures. eFigure 1 shows
the cumulative probability of survival *from the date of diagnosis* while
eFigure2 shows the cumulative probability of survival *from the date of
randomization*.

Those in the intervention arm of the trial who received enhanced
screening may have had their cancers detected earlier and live for a
longer time with a diagnosis. We see some indication of that at the mid-
point of follow-up (eFigure 1) but the prognosis doesn’t differ much
between these two groups. Essentially, measuring survival from the date
of randomization eliminates lead time bias.

# Key practicum 2
*Effect of Aspirin on Disability-free Survival in the Healthy Elderly*

**Describe the counterfactual causal contrast the investigators estimated
for the primary outcome: What was the target population? What were the
exposures under study? What, if any, substitute populations were used?
What proportions were compared?**

Under the counterfactual model, the authors would have liked to observe
the entire target population under a=1 **and** under a=0 over the same time
period. They could then have measured the marginal probability of
experiencing the outcome under both conditions, Pr[Ya=1] **and** Pr[Ya=0].
These two probabilities could be compared to calculate the Risk Ratio(causal)
and/or the Risk Difference(causal) and/or the Rate Ratio(causal).

```
[relative measure]
Risk Ratio(causal)=R1/ R0 
Rate Ratio(causal)= incidence rate (a=1) / incidence rate (a=0)
[absolute measure]
Risk Difference(causal) = R1 -R0
```
This is impossible in the most sitution. Therefore, the authors had to use substitute populations to represent the target population under a=1 and under a=0.

In the problem: the substitute for the target population under a=1 was the
group of Americans and Australians randomized to receive aspirin. The
substitute for the target population under a=0 was the group of Americans
and Australians randomized to receive placebo. Their target population is all healthy elderly persons in the United States and Australia.

```
subsitiude of R1 = C1/D1
subsitiude of R0 = E0/F0
[relative measure]
Risk Ratio(association)=R1/ subsitue of R0
Rate Ratio(association)= incidence rate (a=1) / subsititude incidence rate (a=0)
[absolute measure]
Risk Difference(association) = R1 - subsitue of R0
```

Association is intended to measure the causal. 

All etiologic studies should be designed to estimate  causal contrasts, and the specific contrast of interest  should be carefully defined  in advance.

**The investigators conducted a 4-week placebo run-in phase prior to
randomization.**

**Why do you think this was done? Discuss in terms of the goals of the
trial and the implications for the analytic approach (i.e., ITT vs.
per-protocol analysis)**

The investigators wanted to exclude potential participants who were
unlikely to comply with their assigned treatment.

Side note ITT and PP

![image 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc582d14-406a-4ad6-a476-4846b288586b)

Those who consumed less than 80% of the tablets over the 4-week run-in phase were excluded from the study. The investigators ultimately conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, but the run-in phase suggests that they were primarily interested in whether the treatment was *efficacious.* In other words, they would have liked to run a trial in which all participants were perfectly compliant so as to measure the efficacy of the intervention rather than the effectiveness

**What effect might the decision to exclude those persons have on the
external validity of their conclusions?**

The exclusion of those potential participants who were deemed less
compliant during the run-in phase limits the external validity (or generalizability) of their findings. They may have found a different result among a study sample in which fewer people were compliant.

ITT value more about *external validity*, PP value more about *internal validity*.
```
side note on *external validity* and  *internal validity*
Are the results valid within the study
population, i.e., are they free of bias? • Exclude those who are not at risk of the outcome • Contraindications? • Challenges with follow-up?

External validity: Can the results be generalized from the
study population to the target population?

Internal validity is required for external validity. 

Excluding potential participants in order to protect internal validity may decrease external validity.

```

**Figure 1 indicates that some participants were lost to follow-up or
withdrew from the study following randomization, but these losses are not
reflected in the number analyzed. Why? What are the authors assuming?**

The investigators conducted an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. All participants were assumed to have adhered to their treatment status, including those eventually lost to follow-up. The authors had to assume that the likelihood of experiencing the outcome was the same among those participants lost to follow-up as among those who remained in the trial.

*Water, sanitation, and hygiene for control of trachoma in Ethiopia (WUHA)*

*a two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomised trial*

**Why do you think the authors chose a cluster-randomized trial design to
answer their research question?**

- difficult  randomizing individuals to the WASH intervention.
- an individual’s probability of experiencing the outcome is unlikely to be independent from their neighbor’s

```
 Why cluster?

• Evaluate the effect of exposures or interventions that naturally
occur at a group level: social policies or programs. 

• Evaluate the effect of interventions for which independent
outcomes cannot be assumed
(individual level of outcome does not have meanings)
```

**Participants in this trial were not blinded to their treatment
assignment, i.e., they knew whether they were in the intervention or
control arm of the trial. Do you think this was problematic? Why or why
not?**

This is unlikely to be a problem because all of the outcomes were
measured objectively, e.g., swabbing the right eyelid to test for the
presence of the bacteria that cause trachoma. The lack of blinding would
have been much more problematic if the investigators were relying on
self-reported outcomes.[aka only subjective *self reported out come need participant to be blinded* 

***why use prevelence rather than incidence in this study*** 

In order to measure incident cases, it would have been necessary to test
study participants at much shorter intervals (ideally, daily) to learn
when their infections occurred. This would have been VERY resource
intensive.

prevalence conflates the incidence of infection with the
duration of the infection. This means that children whose infections
lasted longer were more likely to be detected as prevalent cases; those
whose infections were treated quickly (i.e., diagnosed quickly and
effectively treated with antibiotics) would be less likely to be
detected. This is unlikely to pose a problem in this study because there
is no reason to believe that persons in the treatment areas were more
likely to have their infections treated than those in the control arm.

```
prequisite for RCT
equipoise: not sure if treatment is benefitial or not

Exposure must be potentially modifiable
- Genotype, family history cannot be modified

Exposure must be potentially modifiable by the
investigator
-Occupation, marital status, place of residence may be
theoretically modifiable, but often impractical or
unethical for randomization.
```
-> the propose to have control: There may be pre-existing (aka secular) trends in the outcome.
