Happy fall break everyone. I hope you all have a nice fall break. I am sure you sre equally excited about up coming exams! That is why this mid-term special seriers coming up. This will list several study point I went over. Hopefully that will be helpful for your too. I know it is kind of messy… by all means it s made by an electronic raccoon.

Key word for practium 1

*A Measles Outbreak in an Underimmunized Amish Community in Ohio, by Gastañaduy et al.*

***obervational study***

The **risk (or incidence proportion)** is defined as the number of persons who contracted measles during this time period divided by the number of persons at risk.

*Should persons aged 55 and older have been included in the denominator of your risk estimate?*
Depend on if people at aged 55 are at risk(can catch the disease) 

*two tests were conducted simultaneously and that all 69 persons truly had measles*
```
side note for multiple testing 
-> assume how test for positive
Simultaneouse:increase Sensitivity [Reduce False Negative]
Sequential: increase Specificity [Reduce False Positive]

For simultaneous Net sensitivity Calulation:
Net sensitivity = [(# true positives on test1) + (# true positives on test2) – (# test positive on both)] / # cases

Net sensitivity: Sensitivity test1* #cases + False Postive test1* sensitivity test2

For Sequential Net Sensitivity:
Net sensitivity = Sensitivity test1*sensitivity test2

```
Positive predictive value (PPV)  and Negative predictive value(NPV) changes along with the prevelence of the disease.
