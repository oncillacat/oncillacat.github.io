## mid term special seire: EPIB L2
Happy fall break everyone. I hope you all have a nice fall break. I am sure you sre equally excited about up coming exams! That is why this mid-term special seriers coming up. This will list several study point I went over. Hopefully that will be helpful for your too. I know it is kind of messy… by all means it s made by an electronic raccoon.

# rates protions, and ratio
### rate is A/b 
- can be 0 - infinity
- have unit
  
ie. inceidence protportion
  -> person time limitation: assume incedence rate are equvilent
  
 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑢𝑝/𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛 − 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑎𝑡 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑢𝑝

### protprotion is A/(A+B)
- protiontion is alwas 0-1
- does not have value 
ie:incidence proportion( also knows as **risk and culmative incidence**)

=# 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑢𝑝/# 𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒  **𝑎𝑡 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘** 𝑎𝑡 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒

special condition:

𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  ≈ 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑥 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒

( when the incidence proportion (risk) of the event is less than approximately 20%)

PS： person time

100 cases per person-year = 10,000 cases per person-century    
 = 8.33 cases per person-month              
 = 1.92 cases per person-week            
= 0.27 cases per person-day


ie: 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 = # 𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 /𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

In a *stable* population 𝑃/( 1 − 𝑃) = 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ∗𝐷uration

when prevelence is low (<0.1) 𝑃 ≈ 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒  ∗𝐷uration

-> many things can influnence prevelence as it only meansure the impact to current poplulation

… so the most convinient way to reduce prevelence of some disease in your surveyed provience is to ship your patients out of the provience 

**major diff** prevenlene measure the impact; incidence protportion measure association

### Ratio 
change in rate or protprotion
