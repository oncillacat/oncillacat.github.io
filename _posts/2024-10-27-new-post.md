## mid term special seire: EPIB L2
Happy fall break everyone. I hope you all have a nice fall break. I am sure you sre equally excited about up coming exams! That is why this mid-term special seriers coming up. This will list several study point I went over. Hopefully that will be helpful for your too. I know it is kind of messy… by all means it s made by an electronic raccoon.

# Key word for practium 1

*A Measles Outbreak in an Underimmunized Amish Community in Ohio, by Gastañaduy et al.*

***obervational study***

The **risk (or incidence proportion)** is defined as the number of persons who contracted measles during this time period divided by the number of persons at risk.

*Should persons aged 55 and older have been included in the denominator of your risk estimate?*
Depend on if people at aged 55 are at risk(can catch the disease) 

*two tests were conducted simultaneously and that all 69 persons truly had measles*
```
side note for multiple testing 
-> assume how test for positive
Simultaneouse:increase Sensitivity [Reduce False Negative]
Sequential: increase Specificity [Reduce False Positive]

For simultaneous Net sensitivity Calulation:
Net sensitivity = [(# true positives on test1) + (# true positives on test2) – (# test positive on both)] / # cases

Net sensitivity: Sensitivity test1* #cases + False Postive test1* sensitivity test2

For Sequential Net Sensitivity:
Net sensitivity = Sensitivity test1*sensitivity test2

```
Positive predictive value (PPV)  and Negative predictive value(NPV) changes along with the prevelence of the disease.

**Leas time bias**
A typical example of lead time bias is presented here using *Kaplan-Meier curves*

Median survival time corresponds to the point in follow-up when 50% of
the study population is still surviving. Using the figure to visually
approximate, the median survival time appears to be around 3 years after
diagnosis among the usual care group and 4.5 years after diagnosis for
the intervention group. If we used this statistic alone and began follow
up time from date of diagnosis (rather than date of randomization), we
might conclude that treatment **seems beneficial**.

However, a closer look at the figure shows that this seeming advantage
was **short lived**. In later years of follow up (i.e., after year 9) the proportion surviving is roughly equivalent and then falls more quickly
among those in the treated group.

*How to elimate lead time bias?*

The start of follow-up differs between these two figures. eFigure 1 shows
the cumulative probability of survival *from the date of diagnosis* while
eFigure2 shows the cumulative probability of survival *from the date of
randomization*.

Those in the intervention arm of the trial who received enhanced
screening may have had their cancers detected earlier and live for a
longer time with a diagnosis. We see some indication of that at the mid-
point of follow-up (eFigure 1) but the prognosis doesn’t differ much
between these two groups. Essentially, measuring survival from the date
of randomization eliminates lead time bias.
