# Elements in R 
The mystical world of R is built by 4 basic element.

Those basic elements...They are interchangable.But! They don't like each other,so it is not possible to add one element with not its kind.
for example it is fine to add 3 + 5 in an r code because they are all numeric elements
```r
3+5
```
but R will give you an error if you try to 3 + 'text'
```r
3 + "text"
```
The error would be something like this :
*"Error in 3 + 'text' : non-numeric argument to binary operator"*
## Now how do we know who is who? 
well, the first option is 
**class** function 
by simply put elements you want to test in the brackets of `class()`. The class function wlll output what elements the test subjects is. 
ei.`class(3)` will output Numeric

That is all! This should help with the quiz today.
