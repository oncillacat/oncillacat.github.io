Magical cyber racoon bring %>% translator. So you can code in %>% Say thank you cyber racoon.

And agian, I figure actully no one notice what I put on my first post. If you buy me a coffee I would be happy to tutor you R coding, till the coffee run out. 

So Dlyer using a different codeing logic comparing all other coding method that is taught in pervious class. 
Here I will try my best to show how to code in %>%, and how to pull same unit from one data frame using both base r and %>%. But first let me use dyler package... which 

## Dyler to %>%
### select column from a data frame
***dyler****
```
select(data_df_long, "Platform")
```
***%>%***
```
data_df_long %>% select("Platform")
```
### gain summary of table for one Column 
***dyler****
```
table(select(data_df_long, "Platform"))
```
***%>%***
```
data_df_long %>% select("Platform") %>% table()
```
### filter 
***dyler****
```
filter(data_df_long,Platform == "Computer" )
```
***%>%***
```
data_df_long %>% filter(Platform == "Computer") 
```

You can see in %>% language, we are avoiding using ()s. We kind of spreading the code chunck to a line. 
However, until now I still use dyler function to present example. Next example, I would use base r as example.

### gain summary column from a data frame
***base R***
```
table(data_df_long$Platform)
```
***%>%***
```
data_df_long %>% pull(Platform) %>% table()
```
### make a new column in the data frame 
*assume there is no column called coffee_cf in data_df_long*
***base R***
```
data_df_long$coffee_cf = NA
```
***%>%***
```
data_df_long %>% mutate(coffee_cf =NA) 
```
This will create a new column called coffee_cf 


as you can see things got tricker with $ sign which we used to select column in base r in terms of readbility for the code.

Try practice yourself! 

try make this line of code into %>% format
```
data_df_long$coffee_cf = NA
for ( i in 1:length(data_df_long$coffee_cf) {
  if (data_df_long$Drinks[i] == "Coffee" ) {
    data_df_long$coffee_cf[i] = 95}
  else {
    data_df_long$coffee_cf[i] = 0}
}
```
Answer will be on next post tomorrow 

update on Nov7... Ok I lied. Did not really make the next post before this thrusday. 
so... here is the answer
```
data_df_caffeine_Step1 <- data_df %>%
mutate(Coffee_cf = ifelse(grepl("Coffee", Drink), 95, 0)
```
