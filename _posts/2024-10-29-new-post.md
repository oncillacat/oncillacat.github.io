## Midterm Special Seire: PPHS
I hope you all have a "nice" exam week. I am sure you sre equally excited about up coming PPHS exams! That is why this mid-term special seriers coming up. This will list several study point I went over. Hopefully that will be helpful for your too. I know it is kind of messy… by all means it s made by an cyber raccoon.

# Key: Practicum 1 
## Defining Health, Population, and Population Health
Key term: 

*Population*

Defined by 

-> Geographic space and time

-> A defining characteristic, event, or exposure

-> Defined by criteria that promote the likelihood of a successful study
	ie Nurses Health study selected nurse 
 
POPULATION is ALMOST ALWASY DYNAMIC

 &Selected based on considerations that include those of scientific or
public health interest.

**Health** 
It is an culture defined things. It is data and science. It is *a resource which gives people the ability to manage and even to change their surroundings* -- 1986 Canadian Department of National Health and Welfare

**Population Health**
Study of the conditions that shape distributions of health within and across populations, and of the mechanisms through which these conditions manifest in the health of individuals


## Populations, Numerators, and Denominators
**Incidence**  refers to the  onset of disease. 

```
incidence proportion( also knows as *risk and culmative incidence*) 
=# 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑢𝑝/# 𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒  *𝑎𝑡 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘* 𝑎𝑡 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒

𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 = 𝑛𝑒𝑤 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑢𝑝/𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛 − 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑎𝑡 𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑘 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑢𝑝
```

Again: we have person time here. Reminder: person year is convertible between year and date and …

**Prevalence** refers to the proportion of people who possess a certain attribute either at a certain point in time or within a specific time period.
```
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 = # 𝑝𝑒𝑜𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑒 /𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑜𝑝𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
```

Point source or propagated (short-term) changes
Cyclical trends(can be short or long term) 

Other key words to pay a attention to: 
Denominator neglect 
Demographic (balancing) equation : `Pt1-Ptw = (Bt1,t2 - Dt1,t2) +(INt1,t2 -OUTt1,t2)`

::**Total dependency ratio (TDR, %)**::
TDR >100 more dependents than workers 
```
TDR = (P0-14 +P65+)/P15-64 *100 = (population ages 0-14 + population ages 65+)/population ages 15 -64
```

**Sex ration** 
```
Sex ration = #male/#female 
```

### Birth rate indicator 
**Crude birth rate (CBR)**
High ~40 to 50 births per 1000 population 
Low ~10 to 20 births per 1000 population
```
CBR = (B/P)*K
B = total number of live births registered during a calendar year 
P = total mid-year estimated population 
K = a constant usually taken as 1,000
```

::**Rate of natural increase (RNI)**::measure of how quickly a population is
growing or declining due to natural causes (births and deaths),
excluding migration

/Doubling time/:  ~70/RNI
```
RNI % = (Crude Birth Rate/1,000) – (Crude Death Rate/1000) = (CBR-CDR)/1000
```

**Growth rate** 
```
Growth rate (accounts for migration): r = (ln P2 - ln P1)/ t
P1 =  population at time point 1
P2 = population at time point 2 
t = time
Doubling time: t doubling = ln2 /r 
```

**General Fertility Rate(GFR)**
Use this because CBR can be variable, adjust this with age structure
```
GFR = #Births / (mid-year pop of females 15-49) x 1000
```

**Age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs)** 
account for the age structure of the population
```
fx = Bx/Wx x 1000 

fx  = fertility rate at age x 
Bx = # births at age x 
Wx = # females of age x at mid-point in period

```

**Total fertility rate (TFR)**
Average number of children expected to be born to an individual female
over the duration of childbearing years (usually defined as 15-49y), if
experiencing the current ASFRs throughout their lifetime.
/Note: there is a an if in sentence, the whole sentence in build in an imaginary statement/
```
TFR = Sum(from 15 -49) fx or 5x Sum(from 15-19 to 45-49) fx 

• where fx = fertility rate at age x 
• Period fertility rate, expressed per female or per 1000 females 
• Total reproductive output for a given population 
• Not affected by age composition
```

**Cohort fertility rates**
t the age-specific fertility rates are captured from the same cohort followed through time until the end of their childbearing age
```
CFRk = sum(15 to 49) 

k =specific birth cohort
```

**Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR)**
average number of female offspring that a female would have if they survived through reproductive years

_GRR <1 Insufficient reproductivity for replacement_ 

_GRR >1 Sufficient for replacement_ 

_GRR =1 Zero growth_

```
GRR = TFR x pw
```

### death rate to remember in Practicum 1 
*note: those case are usually measured case per 1000 

**Crude death rate** = `#total number of death/ mid-year population`

**Age-specific death rates** =`(annual # of deaths in specific sub-groups /total population in sub-group`

**Case fatality rate** = `# of deaths from specific disease /total # of new cases of that disease`

Brith related(also all in
**neonatal mortality rate** =`neonatal death/live birth`

**infant mortality rate** = `infant death/ live birth`

**maternal mortality rate** =`maternal death/ live birth`


Death is not a main character in practicum 1 celebrate life!

### indicator for health and disease 
*Health-adjusted life-expectancy* (HALE): the mean # of years that a
person at a give age can expect to live in the ‘equivalent’ of full health 

**Disease or disability-free** life expectancy: the mean # of years that a
person at a give age can expect to live without disease or disability

**Health-Adjusted Life Years (HALYs)** refer to a large category of
population health summary measures used to estimate burden of
disease.
	Sub groups are our good friends:
	1. Disability-adjusted life year (DALYs) 
	2.  Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)

* Typically measured using a 0 to 1.0 scale
  *  DALYs health gap (1= full disability/death vs 0=full health)
	* QALYs measure of health expectancy (1=full health vs 0=death) 
*  Each unit is numerically equivalent (0.2-0.3 = 0.7-0.8)
  
***QALY =1 good, DALY =1 bad!***

```
DALY = YLL + YLD = (Life expectancy – Age at death) + (disability weight * # years with disability)

*If life expectancy and age at death is not provided, just cross that part

QALYs = additional years of life x HRQoL(health-related quality of life)

```

DALY is use to measure the burden of disease 
QALY using to calculate quality life remaining
